<p><strong>Age:</strong> 22</p>
<p><strong>Occupation:</strong> President of Kennedy Island's Marine Rescue & Rehabilitation Hospital </p>
<p><strong>About:</strong> Greyson Elijah Harrington was born on December 2, 1977 in Outer Banks, North Carolina to Vincent and Olivia Eileen Harrington.  The Harrington family moved to Clearwater, Florida in 1979.  Shortly thereafter, Vincent and Olivia Eileen had Kurt Harrington in 1980.  A sister, Alaina (married, Hutchins) was born in 1995.  A decade and a half after Greyson’s birth, his brother Jeremy Harrington was born in 1985.  For the entirety of Greyson’s childhood, he recalls annual family vacations to the old family island located off the banks of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.  The family island was named “Old Kennedy Island” after the family’s descendants who owned the land.  Greyson always had a fascination with the island, one that most likely stemmed from his strong draw after marine life as well as his family history.  During his years in university, Greyson began an extensive research project on the island.  He found out that the island still belonged to his family.  He began to reach out to extended family members.  They were all more than happy to sign the land deeds over to him.  By 1995, Harrington legally owned the entirely island..</p>
